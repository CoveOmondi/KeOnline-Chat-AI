# KeOnline-Chat-AI

This is a model which acts as a chatbot created as a mini-concept of OpenAI's GPT3.5

The model is fed with data from a CSV/Excel sheet.
Data is tokenized and preprocessed then the model trained on the dataset and can answer questions strictly related to it. 
However, via the OpenAI API the model can still answer logically to questions which are not related to the data. 

This is a test model, with gradual improvements and revamps still getting actioned on behind the scenes.
